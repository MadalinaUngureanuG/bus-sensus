# Getting Started

This is a Bus Sensus Project with React that uses Next.js.

You will need Node.js installed on your system for this to work.

**This project has a form page where you can select a bus number, and then automatically it gets you only the routes for the bus selected. Once the route is selected you can choose the station where you are and then introduce the number of people on the bus. For the moment this project works with some dummy data.
It also has another page with a table where you can see data about the information from the form completed by users.**
